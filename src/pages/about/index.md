### Front End Developer based in Edinburgh, Scotland

I work primarily in Javascript / React but also have experience in C#, Java, Python and Ruby. 

This site is a journal of my attempt to learn one new thing that will make me a better developer each day. This is primarily a resource for myself to refer back to and organise the mass of information I try to process each day. Most posts will be based around an article, course, video or book.
